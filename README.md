## What is this website?
This website was made as a way for me to experiment more "wildly" with the react eco-system. 

## How was this website useful to experiment?
Throughout it's development, the website morphed from one thing to another, using different tools and technologies that enabled me to see how they would interact with each other under atypical circumstances. Which proved to be very helpful and provided me with a lot of new information.

By closely interracting with these technologies and seeing how they behave in different situations I acquired knowledge that would otherwise be *forgettable*  had I read it or seen it somewhere else, plus the problem-solving was rather intuitive this way, rather than imagining a problem in my head and trying to find an answer online, I already had the problem in front of me and it was up to me to solve it. This created a dynamic that made the information much more valuable and therefore much more retainable.

## How did it go?
It was very fun, it allowed me to explore deep parts about the react eco-system, rather than just understanding how things work I understood *why* they work the way they do, why changes were made and how react evolved throughout its lifetime.

## Is this project done?
This project is definitely not done yet. There is a lot to be improved still, and I plan on working on it more in the future and give it the care it deserves.
